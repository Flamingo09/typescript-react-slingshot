This project is built using [react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) by cory house, version 7.0.0.

Typescript with react-hot-load is enabled using babel-loader, by following this guide [react-hot-loader typescript conf](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader#typescript)

All commands and configurations are same as react-slingshot. Just have added my eslintrc and tsconfig, which users can edit according to their need.
Have upgraded to webpack 4.44.0

This is all set to be used as template.
